# Global Health Analysis

This website presents an exploratory data analysis of global health indicators
and their relationship to economic conditions across countries.

We combine **COVID-19 health data** from the [Google COVID-19 Open Data project](
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/covid-19-open-data) with **GDP per capita**
from the [World Bank API](https://api.worldbank.org/), and build a cleaned dataset
that can be reused for future work. We'll walk you through the entire process if
you would like to reproduce the same project at your own time!

## 1. Data Sources & Retrieval

We use two main sources:

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Health Data

- Provider: **Google / Harvard Global Health Institute (COVID-19 Open Data)**
- Format: CSV (`health.csv`)
- Access: Public Google Cloud Storage bucket  
- URL:  
  `https://storage.googleapis.com/covid19-open-data/v3/health.csv`
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Economic Data

- Provider: **World Bank**
- Indicators:
  - `NY.GDP.PCAP.CD` — GDP per capita (current US$)
- Format: JSON from World Bank REST API
- Access: Public API endpoint
:::
:::

See the **Data & Methods** page for the exact Python code used to:

- Download `health.csv` directly from the URL
- Query the World Bank API for GDP per capita
- Merge both into a single tidy DataFrame (`df_clean`)

---

## 2. Key Questions

We focus on questions such as:

- How do **health outcomes** vary across income levels?
- Is there a visible relationship between **GDP per capita** and
  **COVID-19 burden** (e.g., cases or deaths per 100k)?
- Which regions appear as **outliers** in terms of health vs. income?

These are explored in more depth on the **Analysis & Visuals** page.

## 3. Interactive Exploration

Below is an example interactive widget that lets you explore a subset of
our final dataset. In the full project, this will be replaced by a plot
using the real `df_clean` DataFrame.

```{python}
import plotly.express as px
import pandas as pd

demo = pd.DataFrame({
    "country": ["A", "B", "C", "D"],
    "gdp_per_capita_usd": [1000, 5000, 15000, 25000],
    "cases_per_100k": [200, 800, 1200, 400]
})

fig = px.scatter(
    demo,
    x="gdp_per_capita_usd",
    y="cases_per_100k",
    hover_name="country",
    title="Demo: GDP per Capita vs Cases per 100k"
)
fig
```

## 4. Key Visualizations

Here are some of the main figures from our analysis.

### Model Performance
